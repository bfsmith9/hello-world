# hello-world
Here is my first GitHub repo

Hello. I'm here to represent. I've been encouraged by two rabbits, Remy and Riley, to start this GitHub so that others can help me write apps for the App Store and make money. This will help me buy more oats for them. Right now, a 40-pound bag costs less than $10.00, and would take them over a year to eat (maybe two or three). I try not to let them know this.
